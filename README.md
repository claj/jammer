This is a Jammer, a clever MIDI-keyboard layout for you computer keyboard. The layout is much more fun than a piano-layout, since it's isotonic - to transpose the melody, just move your whole hand in one of six directions.

# ALPHA. This was made in an afternoon.

## Usage

If you want to play a program in your computer, configure a MIDI loop-back device. On Mac OS X this is built in, search your Mac for \"Audio MIDI Setup\", chose Window->Show MIDI window. When in doubt, there's a [youtube movie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgFA_fdup7g).

Otherwise just make sure you have some external MIDI-module connected to a MIDI-port at your computer. Preferably a nice synth lead with some filtered delay effect on.

After this it should be to just

`git clone https://github.com/claj/jammer.git`

`lein run`

and you can select your MIDI out-port. The program itself shows when it has focus, and the midi-label should twinkle very discretly when it sends MIDI.
